    "- There's a clear hierarchical relationship (IS-A)\n",

    "## 7. Pythonic Best Practices\n",
    "### 7.1. \"Composition over Inheritance\" is strong in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to duck typing and dynamic nature, composition is often cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2. Use ABCs for Interface Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Database(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def connect(self): ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def disconnect(self): ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class MySQLDatabase(Database):  # Proper inheritance for interface\n",
    "    def connect(self):\n",

    "    \n",
    "    def disconnect(self):\n",
    "        return \"MySQL disconnected\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3. Consider Composition with Delegation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Logger:\n",
    "    def log(self, message):\n",
    "        print(f\"LOG: {message}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Application:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.logger = Logger()  # Composition\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        # Delegate logging to composed object\n",
    "        self.logger.log(\"Application started\")\n",
    "        return \"Running...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4. Mixins for Horizontal Reuse\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class SerializableMixin:\n",
    "    def serialize(self):\n",
    "        return vars(self)\n",
    "\n",
    "class EquatableMixin:\n",

    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.price = price\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.8. Common Pitfalls\n",
    "Inheritance Pitfalls:\n",
    "- Fragile Base Class Problem: Changes in parent break children\n",
    "- Deep Hierarchies: Hard to understand and maintain\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance Conflicts: Which parent's method gets called?\n",
    "- Overuse: Not everything needs to be in a hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition Pitfalls:\n",
    "- Boilerplate Code: Need to delegate all methods\n",
    "- Object Proliferation: Many small objects\n",
    "- Complex Initialization: Need to create all composed objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.9. Modern Python Patterns\n",
    "Protocols (Structural Subtyping)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "from typing import Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "class Drawable(Protocol):\n",
    "    def draw(self) -> str: ...\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def draw(self) -> str:  # No inheritance, just implements protocol\n",
    "        return \"Drawing circle\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Square:\n",
    "    def draw(self) -> str:  # Same protocol\n",
    "        return \"Drawing square\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def render(shape: Drawable):  # Accepts any object with draw() method\n",
    "    return shape.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Both work without inheriting from Drawable!\n",
    "render(Circle())\n",
    "render(Square())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrap-up\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is flexible: Supports both patterns well\n",
    "- Composition shines in Python due to duck typing\n",
    "- Inheritance is useful for true IS-A relationships and polymorphism\n",
    "- Mixins and Protocols provide alternatives to traditional inheritance\n",
    "- Choose based on relationship type: IS-A → Inheritance, HAS-A → Composition\n",
    "- When in doubt, start with composition - it's easier to change later\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: Inheritance describes what something IS, composition describes what something HAS/DOES. In Python's dynamic world, what something DOES (its behavior) is often more important than what it IS (its type)."
